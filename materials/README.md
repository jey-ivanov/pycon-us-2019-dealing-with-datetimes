# Dealing with Datetimes: Materials

This folder contains the materials for the tutorial. The material is designed to be used both as part of a presentation *or* for self-paced learning.

Within each section, there should be an `*_answers.py` module, containing the answers to the exercises, and a `*_tests.py` containing some tests for the exercises. Feel free to consult these if you are having trouble with the exercises.

## Covered material

Not all the material here will be covered in the 3-hour tutorial. The material used in the tutorial is:

1. [Introductory slides](https://pganssle-talks.github.io/pycon-us-2019-dealing-with-datetimes): These are covered first.
2. [`01-time_zones`](01-time_zones/): Only the first 4 workbooks are covered.
3. [`02-serializing_deserializing`](02-serializing_deserializing/): Only the first 2 workbooks are covered.
4. [`03-recurring_events`](03-recurring_events/): Both workbooks are covered.

The `04-calendar_arithmetic` section is a bonus, and will not be covered.

Each section is fairly independent of one another and can be done in any order, though the workbooks within a section *generally* build upon one another.
